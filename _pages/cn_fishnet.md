  Kochi is one charming city with the kindest souls. I was there for a very brief period, and I was told not to miss the Chinese styled fishing. So, I left early in the morning to catch a glimpse of the exalted fishers. I am very petit, and if anybody sees me with my big camera, they get stunned a little. As I was taking pictures, one of the fishers couldn't help but notice me and asked me to join them on the pier. Watching them break their backs from so close, It was a thrilling experience to be a part of them.  
    
  As I got talking to the fishers, I realized how much rubbish is lying around. They also complained that somedays they don't catch even a single fish due to the polluted ocean water. I feel that it is we, who are being hard on ourselves by being ignorant to mother nature. It is so naive of us not to realize that we are cutting off the very branch we are sitting on.
