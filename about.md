			I have been working as a Technical Artist in the video game industry since 2008. Currently I live in San Diego, California with my lovely wife and three kids. I was born in Panama to a missionary family. Growing up in different countries in South America, I had the blessing of learning their culture and making lifelong friendships.<br><br>

			I've had a passion for art since as far back as I can remember, and I still enjoy the idea of creating images that can bring smiles to peoples faces. My work in video games is fairly technical - involving programming, advanced math, and plenty of problem solving. Rather than staring at a screen, holding a brush in my hand and feeling the paint glide on the surface I’m painting on is the creative outlet that I look forward to after a long day of overusing the left side of my brain.<br><br>

			While I'm still exploring and experimenting with my personal style, I have found something that I enjoy and would love to share with all of you.
			My favorite subjects to paint are wildlife, flowers, and other curious things inspired by nature. I also enjoy character design, which is something I want to start exploring more often.
			If you read this far, thank you! I hope my work can inspire you and you can learn a little something in the fun facts section.<br>
