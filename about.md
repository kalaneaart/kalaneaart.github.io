			Welcome to my site! I'm a Technical Artist working in the video game industry since 2008. Currently I live in San Diego, California with my lovely wife and three kids.<br>

			I was born in Panama to a missionary family, and grew up in different countries in South America where I had the blessing of learning their culture and making lifelong friendships.<br>

			I've had a passion for art since I can remember, and still today I enjoy the idea of creating images that can bring smiles to peoples faces. My work in video games is fairly technical  involving programming, advanced math and plenty of problem solving. Not staring at a screen, but holding a brush in my hand and feeling the paint glide on the surface I’m painting on is the creative outlet that I look forward to after a long day of overusing the left side of my brain.<br>

			While I'm still exploring and experimenting with my personal style, I think I have found something that I enjoy and would love to share with all of you.
			My favorite subjects to paint are wildlife and flowers among other curious things inspired by nature. I also enjoy character design, which is something I want to start exploring more often.
			If you read this far, thank you! I hope these images can inspire you and you can learn a little something in the fun facts section.<br>
